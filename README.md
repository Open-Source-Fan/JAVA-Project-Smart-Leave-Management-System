# 👥 Team Members and Responsibilities
-Parul Rana (24CSU292) took primary responsibility for file handling and persistent data storage, ensuring smooth saving and retrieval of records. She managed 
arrays of objects for both users and leave requests, and organized the official project documentation (including the comprehensive report). Parul prepared and 
designed the project PowerPoint presentation, formatted all UI text and tables for clarity and professionalism, created sample input/output screens for 
demonstration, and contributed significantly to functionality testing and quality assurance.

-Shubhangi Tyagi (24CSU294), I led the overall system architecture and was responsible for designing the core class structure, implementing constructors, and 
establishing the package organization. I managed the main control flow, developed menu navigation logic, and implemented advanced features including robust 
exception handling, the blockchain-inspired audit logging mechanism, and data export functionality (CSV/TXT).

Additionally, we both handled bug fixing, full-system integration, and complete feature testing to ensure a reliable, user-friendly application.
